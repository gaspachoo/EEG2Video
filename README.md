# EEG2Video Pipeline 
Acronyms used:
-   EEG = ElectroEncephaloGram
-   DE = Differential Entropy
-   PSD = Power Spectral Density

## 1. Data Preprocessing  ($\approx$ 1 week)
### 1. EEG data segmentation:

**Purpose** : Segment raw  8min 40s EEG recordings into shorter recordings 

- First step :

    Segment (62 channels, 200Hz, 8min40s)  into 2s windows (per video : 40 concepts, 5 repetitions per concept, remove hint sequences)

    Shapes are : (block, concept, repetition, channel, time).

    Script : `EEG_preprocessing/segment_raw_signals_200Hz.py`
    (also exposes `extract_2s_segment` to grab a single 2‑second window on the fly)

- Second step :
    
    Segment each 2s windows into 500ms windows using a 250 ms overlap (=7 windows)

    Shapes adapted to (block, concept, repetition, window, channel, time).

    Script : `EEG_preprocessing/segment_sliding_window.py`

### 2. DE/PSD Features detection on 5 frequency bands:

**Purpose**: detect DE and PSD features on segmented EEGs, on 5 different frequency bands:

- Delta (1-4 Hz)
- Theta (4-8 Hz)
- Alpha (8-14 Hz)
- Beta (14-31 Hz)
- Gamma (31-99 Hz)

We detect on 3 types of windows :

- Detect features on 2s raw windows.

    Shapes adapted to (block, concept, repetition, channel, band).

    Script : `EEG_preprocessing/extract_DE_PSD_features_1per2s.py`

- Detect features on 500ms windows with a 250 ms overlap.

    Shapes adapted to (block, concept, repetition, window, channel, band).

    Script : `EEG_preprocessing/extract_DE_PSD_features_1per500ms.py`

### 3. Video alignment and GIF creation:

**Purpose** : Segment raw  8min 40s Video recordings into shorter downscaled GIFs

- Segment 8 min 40s videos into 200 (40 concepts × 5 repetitions) 2s clips  using cv2.

    Downscale to (512, 288), extract 6 frames (3 FPS) and save to .gif format using imageio.

    Script: `EEG2Video/extract_gif.py`




## 2. EEG Feature Encoding ($\approx$ 2 weeks)

### Purpose :

We use a GLMNet which uses a ShallowNet on raw EEGs, and a MLP on DE/PSD features to extract features from EEGs.

One layer in Shallownet is modified compared to original : AvgPool2d -> AdaptiveAvgPool2d

Models path : `EEG2Video/GLMNet/models.py` 

### Training :

Training uses 2s raw EEGs split into 500&nbsp;ms sliding windows for DE/PSD features.
The pre‑segmented data is stored in `Segmented_500ms_sw` and `DE_500ms_sw`.

Script : `EEG2Video/GLMNet/train_glmnet.py`

An alternative, lighter model that relies only on spectral features can be
trained with `EEG2Video/GLMNet/train_glfnet_mlp.py`.

- Raw EEGs are normalized per channel using the training split statistics.
- Both trainers accept a `--scheduler` argument (`steplr`,
  `reducelronplateau`, `cosine`) and a `--min_lr` value to set the learning rate
  floor.
- `train_glmnet.py` can load several subjects at once with `--subjects`
  (e.g. `--subjects sub3.npy sub4.npy`) and allows filtering the dataset
  with `--cluster-id` to keep only samples belonging to a given label cluster.

### Inference :
    
We generate EEgs embeddings from train GLMNet.

We use 2s raw EEGs and 500ms windows for DE/PSD features.

The same normalization parameters are loaded to preprocess raw EEGs at inference time.

Script : `EEG2Video/GLMNet/inference_glmnet.py`

Embeddings can also be produced with the features‑only model using
`EEG2Video/GLMNet/inference_glfnet_mlp.py`.




## 3. Seq2Seq Transformer ($\approx$ 1 week)

### Purpose :

We align EEG embeddings with videos

The model is just a rewriting of original model : `EEG2Video/Seq2Seq/models/transformer.py`

### Training :

#### 1. Generate latents from pretrained VAE:

- A pre-trained VAE is used to convert 6-frame video GIFs (shape [n_frames, sample_f, height, width] = [6, 3, 288, 512]) into latent tensors [n_frames, d1, d2, d3] = [6, 4, 36, 64] where d1, d2, d3 are due to VAE model.

    Script : `EEG2Video/Seq2Seq/generate_video_latents.py`

#### 2. Use Seq2Seq model to align EEGs embeddings and video latents

- We use the generated EEG embeddings from part 2 as source (shape : `[batch, 7, 512]`) and the video latents from part 3.1 as target (shape : `[batch, 6, 9216]`).
- Training shifts the target sequence by one step: `tgt_in[:,1:] = tgt[:,:-1]` and the first step is filled with zeros. The decoder therefore receives the previous latent at each time step instead of the ground truth.
- The option `--stats_path` defines where to save `mean_z` and `std_z` when `--normalize` is active (default: `--save_path`). The resulting `stats.npz` must also be provided at inference to restore the latents to their original scale.

    Script : `EEG2Video/Seq2Seq/train_seq2seq_v2.py`

 ### Inference : 

We use the generated EEG embeddings from part 2 to generate predicted latents.

Script : `EEG2Video/Seq2Seq/inference_seq2seq_v2.py`
- During inference, provide the same `--stats_path` to restore latents to their original scale.





## 4. Semantic Predictor ($\approx$ 2 days)

### Purpose :
We use a semantic predictor to align EEG features with BLIP captions

Model path : `EEG2Video/SemanticPredictor/models.py`

### Training :

#### 1. Generate text embeddings

- We process the BLIP captions into pretrained CLIP model to generate text embeddings.

    Script : `EEG2Video/SemanticPredictor/generate_text_emb.py`

#### 2. Align EEG features with BLIP captions

    
- We use the DE/PSD features of part 2 as source and the text embeddings from part 4.1 as target.

    Script : `EEG2Video/SemanticPredictor/train_semantic.py`

### Inference : 

- We used the generated text embeddings from part 4.1 to generate semantic embeddings.

    Script : `EEG2Video/SemanticPredictor/inference_semantic.py`




## 5. TuneAVideo pipeline ($\approx$ 3 weeks)

### Purpose : We use the TuneAVideo pipeline to improve the quality of the video latents from part 3 in adding context thanks to semantic predictor.

### Training :

- We use the predicted latents of part 3.2 as source and semantic embeddings of part 4.2 as a target to finetune the TuneAVideo pipeline.

    Script : `EEG2Video/TuneAVideo/train_tuneavideo_v7.py --mixed_precision --batch_size 7 --use_xformers --num_workers 2 --pin_memory --use_empty_cache --use_channels_last`

### Inference :
    
- We generate precise video latents, and respective videos from predicted latents of part 3.2.

    Script : `EEG2Video/TuneAVideo/inference_tuneavideo.py`
